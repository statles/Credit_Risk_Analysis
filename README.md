# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using supervised machine learning and python to assess credit risk

## Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to use several supervised machine learning techniques to analyze credit risk of loan applicants. Since credit risk is an inherintly skewed dataset, the analysis utilizes various forms of handling imablanced data, including SMOTEENN, random oversampling, and random forests. The performance of these different types of machine learning is then evaluated based on precision, accuracy, f1 score and .

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
- Balanced Accuracy Scores:
  - Oversampling: 0.6573
  - SMOTE: 0.6622
  - Undersampling: 0.5442
  - SMOTEENN: 0.6231
  - Balanced Random Forests: 0.7885
  - Easy Ensemble: 0.9316
Conclusion: The Easy Ensemble Classifier had the best balanced accuracy score and the random undersampling had the worst balanced accuracy score.
